 existing cloud service project.



##Exercise 3:	Debugging worker roles in a cloud service project

####Task 1: Add a breakpoint to the worker role

1. Open the **WorkerRole.cs** file in the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project.

2. Find the function **CheckMessages**.

3. Find the following line of code:

   HandleMessage(message);

4. Add a breakpoint to it by left-clicking on the left side of the file window.

####Task 2:	Debug the worker role



1.  In the **Solution
 Explorer** pane, right-click the **Contoso.Events.Cloud** project, and then click **Set as Startup Project**.


2.  On the **Debug** menu,
 click **Start Debugging**.



  >  **Note:** Throughout this course we will use the
   **Azure Compute Emulator** to test and debug our Cloud Services. The
   emulator provides a fast and local option for testing your Cloud
   Services before deploying them to the Azure platform. Occasionally you
   may seem an odd error with the emulator such as an incorrect port
   number or a page not displaying. If this ever occurs, you can simply
   **Shutdown** the compute emulator and Visual Studio will **Start** the
   emulator the next time you try to debug your project.** **



1.  On the homepage of the
 **Contoso Events** website, click the name of any event.


2.  Click **Generate Sign-In
 Sheet** .

3. Wait for the breakpoint to be hit.

4. Click **Continue** in Visual Studio.

5.  Refresh the page once every
 30 seconds until the sign-in sheet is generated.



  >  **Note:** You will notice that the text of the
   button changes from **Generate Sign-In Sheet** to **Download Sign-In
   Sheet** indicating that sign-in sheet generation is complete.



6.  Click **Download Sign-In
 Sheet** to download the Word document.


7.  At the bottom of the
 Internet Explorer window, click **Open** in the download dialog box.


8.  Observe the content of the
 .docx file that you opened in WordPad.


9.  Close the **WordPad**
 application.


10.  Close the **Internet
 Explorer** application.


11.  Close the **Contoso.Events –
 Microsoft Visual Studio** application.



 >  **Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have debugged a
 worker role.
