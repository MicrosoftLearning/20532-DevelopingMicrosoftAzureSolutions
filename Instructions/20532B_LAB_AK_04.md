closing parenthesis of the **Seed(EventsContext context)** method, and
then type the following lines of code:


Event eventItem = new Event();

eventItem.EventKey = "FY17SepGeneralConference";

eventItem.StartTime = DateTime.Today;

eventItem.EndTime = DateTime.Today.AddDays(3d);

eventItem.Title = "FY17 September Technical Conference";

eventItem.Description = "Sed in euismod mi.";

eventItem.RegistrationCount = 1;



Place the cursor before the
 closing parenthesis of the **Seed(EventsContext context)** method, and
 then type the following line of code:


context.Events.Add(eventItem);



Place the cursor before the
 closing parenthesis of the **Seed(EventsContext context)** method, and
then type the following lines of code:


Registration registrationItem = new Registration();

registrationItem.EventKey = "FY17SepGeneralConference";

registrationItem.FirstName = "Aisha";

registrationItem.LastName = "Witt";



Place the cursor before the
 closing parenthesis of the **Seed(EventsContext context)** method, and
 then type the following line of code:


context.Registrations.Add(registrationItem);



Place the cursor before the
closing parenthesis of the **Seed(EventsContext context)** method, and
then type the following line of code:


context.SaveChanges();

Save the
EventsContextInitializer.cs file.
