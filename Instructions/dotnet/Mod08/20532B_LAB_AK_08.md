# Module 8: Designing a Communication Strategy by Using Queues and Service Bus

# Lab: Using Queues and Service Bus to Manage Communication Between Web Applications in Azure

## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure Service Bus Namespace

#### Task 1: Create the Service Bus namespace by using the Management Portal

> **Note:** Service Bus functionality is not available yet in the new Portal. Because of this, the existing Management Portal will be used for this lab.** **

On the Start screen, click the **Internet Explorer** tile.

Go to [*https://manage.windowsazure.com*](https://manage.windowsazure.com)

In the email address box, type the email address of your Microsoft account.

In the password box, type the password for your Microsoft account.

Click **Sign In** In the navigation pane on the left side, scroll down, and then click **Service Bus**.

At the bottom of the screen, click **Create**.

In the **Create a Namespace** dialog box, perform the following steps:

In the **Namespace** **Name** box, type **sb20532\[*Your Name*\]**.

In the **Region** list, select the region that is closest to your location.

In the **Type** list, select the **Messaging** option.

In the **Messaging Tier** list, select the **Standard** option.

Click the check mark button to create your namespace.

In the list of **Service Bus** namespaces, click the namespace that you just created.

At the bottom of the screen, click **Connection Information**.

Record the RootManageSharedAccessKey connection string from the **Access connection information** dialog box.

> **Note:** You have to record a connection string from the list of SAS items.

Close the **Access connection information** dialog box.

At the top of the screen, click the **Queues** tab.

At the bottom-left corner of the screen, click **New**.

If it is not automatically selected, select **App Services =&gt; Service Bus =&gt; Queue =&gt; Custom Create**.

In the **Create a Queue** dialog box, perform the following steps:

a. In the **Queue** **Name** box, type **signin**.

In the **Region** list, select the same region that you selected for the namespace.

In the **Namespace** box, provide the value **sb20532\[Your Name\]**.

Click next arrow to move to the next step in the wizard.

Leave all fields as their default values.

Click the check mark button to create the new queue.

> **Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have created a Service Bus namespace by using the Management Portal.

## Exercise 2: Using Azure Queue Storage for Document Generation

#### Task 1: Update worker role to consume requests from the queue

1.  On the Start screen, click **Desktop**.

On the taskbar, click the **File Explorer** icon.

In the Libraries window, go to **Allfiles (F):\\Mod09\\Labfiles\\Starter\\Queues\\Contoso.Events**, and then double-click **Contoso.Events.sln.**

In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **Roles** folder.

In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project.

Double-click the **TableStorageQueueHelper.cs** file.

At the end of the **TableStorageQueueHelper** constructor and before the closing parenthesis, store the **StorageAccount** property from the base class in a *CloudStorageAccount* variable:

CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = base.StorageAccount;

Invoke the **CreateCloudQueueClient** method and assign the result to the *\_queueClient* variable:

\_queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

Invoke the static **CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting** method and assign the result to the *\_signInQueueName* variable:

\_signInQueueName = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("SignInQueueName");

In the **TableStorageQueueHelper** class, find the method with the following signature:

IQueueMessage&lt;CloudQueueMessage&gt; Receive()

Remove the single line of code in the class:

return new TableStorageQueueMessage(null);

At the end of the **Receive** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a new instance of the **CloudQueue** class by calling the **GetQueueReference** method of the *CloudQueueClient* variable by using the **string** name of the queue, as shown in the following code:

CloudQueue queue = \_queueClient.GetQueueReference(\_signInQueueName);

Invoke the **CreateIfNotExists** method to ensure that the queue exists.

queue.CreateIfNotExists();

At the end of the **Receive** method and before the closing parenthesis, invoke the **GetMessage** method of the **CloudQueue** class and store the result in a *CloudQueueMessage* variable, as shown in the following code:

CloudQueueMessage message = queue.GetMessage();

Pass the *CloudQueueMessage* variable into the constructor of the **TableStorageQueueMessage** class and return the result:

return new TableStorageQueueMessage(message);

At the end of the **CompleteMessage** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a new instance of the **CloudQueue** class by calling the **GetQueueReference** method of the *CloudQueueClient* variable by using the **string** name of the queue, as shown in the following code: CloudQueue queue = \_queueClient.GetQueueReference(\_signInQueueName);

Invoke the **CreateIfNotExists** method to ensure that the queue exists:

queue.CreateIfNotExists();

At the end of the **CompleteMessage** method and before the closing parenthesis, invoke the **DeleteMessage** method by using the *CloudQueueMessage* variable as the parameter, as shown in the following code:

queue.DeleteMessage(message);

#### Task 2: Update administration application to add requests to the queue

1.  In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **Shared** folder.

In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **Contoso.Events.ViewModels** project.

CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(tableStorageConnectionString);

Create a new instance of the **CloudQueueClient** class by using the **CreateCloudQueueClient** method of the *CloudStorageAccount* variable:

CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

After the above mentioned code, create a new instance of the **CloudQueue** class by invoking the **GetQueueReference** method of the *CloudQueueClient* variable by using the queue name string variable, as shown in the following code.:

CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference(signInQueueName);

Invoke the **CreateIfNotExists** method of the **CloudQueue** class to ensure that the queue exists:

queue.CreateIfNotExists();

After the above mentioned code, create a new instance of the **CloudQueueMessage** class by passing in the string **message** into the constructor:

CloudQueueMessage queueMessage = new CloudQueueMessage(message);

Invoke the **AddMessage** method of the *CloudQueue* variable by using the **CloudQueueMessage** as the parameter:

<span id="List_205" class="anchor"></span>queue.AddMessage(queueMessage);

#### Task 3: Generate the test data

Click **OK**.

On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Debugging**.

> **Note:** Throughout this course we will use the **Azure** **Compute** **Emulator** to test and debug our Web App. The emulator provides a fast and local option for testing your Web App before deploying them to the Azure platform. Occasionally you may seem an odd error with the emulator such as an incorrect port number or a page not displaying. If this ever occurs, you can simply **Shutdown** the compute emulator and Visual Studio will **Start** the emulator the next time you try to debug your project.** **

string serviceBusConnectionString = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");

Store the queue name in a string variable.

string signInQueueName = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("SignInQueueName");

Invoke the static **QueueClient.CreateFromConnectionString** method using the queue name and connection string as parameters, and assign the result to the *\_client* variable, as shown in the following code:

\_client = QueueClient.CreateFromConnectionString(serviceBusConnectionString, signInQueueName);

In the **ServiceBusQueueHelper** class, find the method with the following signature:

IQueueMessage&lt;BrokeredMessage&gt; Receive()

Remove the single line of code in the class:

return new ServiceBusQueueMessage(null);

At the end of the **Receive** method and before the closing parenthesis, create a new instance of the **CloudQueue** class by calling the **GetQueueReference** method of the *CloudQueueClient* variable using the **string** name of the queue, as shown in the following code:
